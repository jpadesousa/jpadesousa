### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a doctoral candidate at ETH ZÃ¼rich (with an MSc in Biochemistry and a BSc in Civil Engineering) studying the epigenetic, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation dynamics in pluripotent stem cells.

I like to research complex systems and uncover their mechanisms. Currently, I apply computational and statistical tools to analyse next-generation sequencing data.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning, Generalized Linear Models
